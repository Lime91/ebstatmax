add_effect(data, params, options, config)
}
\arguments{

}
\description{
In order to simulate power of a statistical test, a random effect is added
to the (permuted) target variable values. Thus, a situation in which H1
holds is established. The distribution of the additive effect is specified
by user command line arguments together with a config object. Depending on
the (user-specified) target variable, the respective values will be
truncated after the effects have been added. Moreover, users may choose to
binarize the target variable, which is done also in this function.Â´

\details{
data is modified in place.

options$scenario determines the simulation scenario. If
options$scenario == 1, only independent main effects are added.
options$scenario == 2 means that, in addition to the main effects, also
dependent effects are added.

options$target contains the name of the target variable in data.
options$binarize determines if the target should be binarized (cf.
binarize_target).
config$max_values contains a named vector with maximum values for various
target variables.
Moreover, options and config must contain all entries required by
add_main_effect and add_dependent_effect.
